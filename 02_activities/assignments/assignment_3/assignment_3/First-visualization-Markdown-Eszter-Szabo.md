# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontario’s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    For the first visualization, I wrote a Python code in VSCode.
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    My intended audience is the general public. 
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    The monthly trend of sales in June 2026.
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I decided to display the daily total sales for June 2026 as a lineplot to show the monthly trend. As frequency of timestamps in the original data was too high, I grouped the sum of sales (y-axis) by days (x-axis). There was 
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I included the source of the data in the code and made general comments about it. Based on my limited knowledge and research, it still has reproducibility issues (live data source, which is not saved as a snapshot; absolute path is included at the end), etc.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I limited the visualization's aesthetics to the minimum. 
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    Toronto residents.
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    As I chose a rather simple dataset, my choices of inclusion and exclusion were quite straightforward. However, I excluded the unique identification numbers and the redemption sale amount, because they did not contribute to the intended message that the visualization ought to convey.
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    The labour of the City of Toronto developers, the staff working at the ferry terminal, etc.
- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio – put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
